Intermediate cybersecurity project.
This project covers several topics of binary exploitation.
On each level we are given a binary with special privileges such that this binary can read a secret password.
Our goal is to modify execution flow of the binary so it read the password.

Here is the list of techniques and concepts covered by this project:
1. Binary disassembling
2. GDB
3. Return address override using buffer overflow
4. Variable override using buffer overflow
5. Code injection using buffer overflow
6. Format string exploit
7. Heap exploits
8. ret2libc exploit
